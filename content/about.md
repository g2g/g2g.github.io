- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Deploy and manage containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes for scalable, resilient systems.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up observability stacks with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and other tools to ensure system reliability and performance.
- **Security Practices**: Integrate DevSecOps principles, including vulnerability scanning, secrets management, and compliance automation.<br/>
<br/>

### Tools & Technologies
---
Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the tools I use daily:
- **Operating Systems**: RedHat, Debian, Archlinux
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **Automation**: Ansible, Terraform, Bash, Python
- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, S3, etc.)
- **Containers**: Docker, QEMU/KVM, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions<br/>
<br/>

### My Philosophy
---
I believe in "Automate Everything" and "Fail Fast, Learn Faster." My goal is to build systems that are robust, scalable, and easy to maintain, while empowering teams to deliver high-quality software at speed.<br/>
<br/>

## üé® My Hobbies: Where Creativity Meets Technology
---
When I'm not working on production-grade systems, I channel my energy into creative and technical hobbies.<br/>These pursuits not only fuel my curiosity but also enhance my problem-solving skills, which I bring back to my professional work.<br/>
<br/>

### 1. 3D Printing üñ®Ô∏è
---
3D printing is my gateway to turning digital designs into tangible objects.<br/>From prototyping to creating functional parts, I love exploring the endless possibilities of additive manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>

- **What I Do**: Design and print custom models, functional tools, and artistic pieces using CAD software like Fusion 360 and slicers like Cura.
- **Projects**:
  - Custom drone frames and accessories
  - Home automation enclosures
  - Miniature models and figurines
- **My Setup**: I use an BambuLab for mechanical and design prints.
- **Learning**: Experimenting with advanced materials (e.g., PETG, TPU) and multi-color printing.<br/>
<br/>

### 2. Drones üöÅ
---
Drones combine my love for electronics, aerodynamics, and software. Building, flying, and programming drones is both a technical challenge and an adrenaline rush.<br/>
<br/>
- **What I Do**: Build custom drones, fly FPV (First Person View) drones, and experiment with autonomous flight.
- **Projects**:
  - Built a 5-inch FPV racing drone with a custom 3D-printed frame.
  - Programmed autonomous flight paths using Ardupilot and Betaflight.
  - Captured aerial footage for personal video projects.
- **My Setup**: DJI FPV goggles, Betaflight flight controllers, and custom-built quadcopters.
- **Learning**: Exploring drone AI, such as object tracking and obstacle avoidance.<br/>
<br/>

### 3. Home Automation üè°
---
Home automation is where I blend technology with everyday life, creating smart, efficient, and fun living spaces.<br/>
<br/>
- **What I Do**: Design and implement smart home systems for lighting, security, climate control, and entertainment.
- **Projects**:
  - Built a custom smart lighting system using ESP32 and Home Assistant.
  - Automated my home security with motion sensors, cameras, and smart locks.
  - Created a voice-controlled entertainment system with Raspberry Pi and Alexa integration.
- **My Setup**: Home Assistant, Raspberry Pi, ESP32/ESP8266 and MQTT for communication.
- **Learning**: Experimenting with energy monitoring and AI-driven automation (e.g., predictive climate control).<br/>
<br/>

### 4. Large Language Models (LLMs) ü§ñ
---
My fascination with large language models (LLMs) stems from their potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology, automate tasks, and generate creative content. I enjoy experimenting with LLMs to build tools, explore their capabilities, and understand their limitations.<br/>
<br/>
- **What I Do**: Experiment with open-source LLMs, fine-tune models, and integrate them into personal projects.
- **Projects**:
  - Built a chatbot for automating customer support scenarios using Hugging Face Transformers.
  - Created a content generation tool to assist with writing technical documentation.
  - Experimented with LLM-powered code review tools to enhance DevOps workflows.
- **My Setup**: I use Python, Ollama and LM-Studio for testing different types of LLM in different use cases.
- **Learning**: Exploring prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and ethical considerations in AI development.<br/>
<br/>

### 5. Security üîí
---
As part of my broader IT watch, I‚Äôm deeply interested in security and enjoy keeping up with the latest trends, tools, and techniques.<br/>
While I‚Äôm not an expert, I‚Äôm passionate about learning how to protect systems, identify vulnerabilities, and stay ahead of threats, especially as it relates to my DevOps work.<br/>
